Now according to the question given that tech11 management different services like office365, Jira, and bitbucket at hetnezer.de that is a server hosting site this site host a server for tech11. Now being a DevOps specialist I need to manage passwords for different services like:


- Microsoft cloud
- Atlassian cloud
- SSH server access
- Web application access to application

Now a pragmatic way that I use to manage credentials for different services is:

- Password for each service must be 8-12 characters that include letters, numbers, and special characters 
- Changing password for each service in 3 months by rotating the password
- Keeping separate passwords for work and home system, also the work laptop password must be different from to phone password
- Never use personal information to create a password (I always use my best friend's family member's names to create a password.)
- Use a simple password that is simple and easy to remember (eg: Akki@microsoft4698, Akki@atlassian4698, etc.) Here password is nearly the same only the platform name changes


Personally, my best friend is Naveen in India, I would create sample password for all my services as mentioned below following the above-written rules
- Microsoft cloud: Naveen@microsoft7982
- Atlassian cloud: Naveen@atlassian7982
- SSH server access: Naveen@ssh7982
- Web application access to the application: Naveen@webapp7982

So, the above-defined approach I would use to create and manage my passwords in a practical way. This is a pragmatic way I manage my passwords.
